# Pendulum Graphs
> Mathematics Extended Essay on Real-World Pendulum Motion

These folders contain all the Python code used to generate graphs for my Mathematics Extended Essay on **Modelling Real-World Pendulum Motion using General Second Order Differential Equations**. They have been organised into different folders, based on the sections of appearance in my Extended Essay.

The main libraries used to generate these graphs were ```matplotlib``` and ```numpy```.
